Constructor:
A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize the attributes of an object when it is created from a class. It is defined within a class and has the same name as the class itself, "init".


class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

# Creating an instance of MyClass and initializing the attribute
student1 = Student("Anand")
print(student1.name)

Inheritance:
    Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOPS which is used to inherit the attributes and methods of base class which can be used by the derived class.
    Types of Inheritance:
        1.Single Inheritance.
        2.Multiple Inheritance.
        3.Multilevel Inheritance.
        
Stack:
    A stack is a linear data structure in computer science that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It can be visualized as a stack of objects where the last object placed on top is the first one to be removed. This structure resembles a real-life stack of plates, where you can only take the topmost plate off.
    
Queue:
    A queue is another common data structure in computer science that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It can be visualized as a line of objects, similar to a queue of people waiting in line at a ticket counter.
    
Data Abstraction:
    Data abstraction is the process of showing the information alone by hiding the details or process behind the information derived.

Data Encapsulation:
    Data Encapsulation is the process of wraping attributes and methods together into a single unit as class.
    
Polymorphism:
    Polymorphism in Python refers to the ability of objects of different types to be used interchangeably based on their shared interface or behavior. It allows different objects to respond to the same method or function call in different ways, depending on their specific implementation.
